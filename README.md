 Sales Forecasting Project For Puma
</div>

## ðŸš©Project Description

>The PUMA Sales Forecasting Project is a comprehensive analysis of sales data and supply chain management for PUMA, a leading lifestyle brand globally recognized for its diverse range of footwear, apparel, and accessories. This project aims to tackle the challenges posed by supply chain disruptions, particularly those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. By leveraging machine learning and predictive analytics, we seek to enhance demand forecasting accuracy, optimize inventory management, and provide actionable insights for PUMA.

## ðŸš©Key Objectives

>The primary objectives of this project are threefold:
>* Demand Forecasting: Develop advanced machine learning models to predict PUMA's future sales accurately, enabling the company to anticipate market trends and customer demands effectively.
>* Inventory Optimization: Implement strategies to proactively manage inventory, minimizing overstocking and storage costs while ensuring products are readily available to meet customer demands.
>* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Rigorously clean and preprocess the dataset, ensuring data quality and consistency for robust analysis.
>* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct in-depth EDA to uncover hidden insights into PUMA's sales patterns, customer preferences, and operational strategies.
>* Model Selection: Evaluate the suitability of ARIMA and LSTM models for sales forecasting, highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses.
>* Feature Engineering: Create new variables or features that may influence sales and supply chain performance.


## ðŸš©Project Highlights

>For Data Cleaning: A meticulous data cleaning process was executed, including merging datasets, handling missing values, and standardizing variables, resulting in a clean dataset of over 2 million rows and 10 effective variables.
>
>For EDA Insights: EDA unveiled critical findings, including the dominance of footwear in PUMA's sales, the impact of color and gender on product preferences, and high cancellation rates indicating supply challenges.
>
>For ARIMA and LSTM Models: We applied both ARIMA and LSTM models to forecast sales, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach. These models lay the foundation for more sophisticated predictions.


## ðŸš©Recommendations

>* Advanced Forecasting Models: Consider exploring more advanced forecasting models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which may better capture complex sales patterns, especially when faced with significant fluctuations.
>* Supply Chain Resilience: Develop strategies to enhance supply chain resilience, including diversifying suppliers and investing in inventory management systems to mitigate future disruptions.
>* Customer-Centric Approach: Tailor marketing strategies and product offerings to align with customer preferences revealed in the analysis, optimizing sales performance.
>* Data Enrichment: Continuously enrich the dataset with additional relevant variables and external data sources to improve prediction accuracy and strategic decision-making.
>* Collaborative Partnerships: Explore collaborations with influencers, athletes, and celebrities to leverage the star effect in driving sales, as evidenced in the analysis.
